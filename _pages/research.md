My current research experience lies in AIoT and Ubiquitous Computing, with a focus on analyzing and modelling wireless signals.  I am working / have worked on the following areas:

## 1. Statistical Acoustic Sensing  

**[[MOBISYS '24 Demo](https://doi.org/10.1145/3643832.3661846)] Statistical Acoustic Sensing For Real-Time Respiration Monitoring and Presence Detection**
